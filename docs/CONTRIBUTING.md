3. Include comments in your code where necessary.
4. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
5. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
6. Include a description of your changes and why they're necessary.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For version bumps, use the following npm commands:

### For pre-release versions (e.g., 1.0.0-rc.0):
- To increment to the next pre-release (e.g., 1.0.0-rc.1): `npm version prerelease`
- To bump to the release version (e.g., 1.0.0): `npm version minor` (or `npm version major` if it's a major release)

### For release versions (e.g., 1.0.0):
- To bump the patch version (e.g., 1.0.0 to 1.0.1): `npm version patch`
- To bump the minor version (e.g., 1.0.0 to 1.1.0): `npm version minor`
- To bump the major version (e.g., 1.0.0 to 2.0.0): `npm version major`

Please ensure you update the version number appropriately with your changes.
